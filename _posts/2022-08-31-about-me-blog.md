# About Me Blog

My name is Avery Pfeiffer (_she/her/hers_) and I am currently a senior majoring in Social Work at Christopher Newport University.

Before I found my way to CNU as a sophomore, I attended a school in West Virginia called West Liberty University where I studied zooscience. Now I know what you might be thinking, “_that’s a lot different than social work_”, and you would be right, but I learned a lot during my year at West liberty.

I tend to be pretty stubborn, so my whole life I was set on working with animals, but while I am still extremely passionate about animals, it was not something that enjoyed studying. During this time I had to reevaluate what I wanted to get out of my education and where I see myself in the future. This is how I found my way to social work and I am so grateful to have had the chance to have found this major and all it encompasses.

I gravitated towards the social work major not just because I love helping people but because of so many factors. Social work is such a broad term that encompasses so many different people, cultures, occupations, and experiences. Social work gives me the chance to interact with all different kinds of people and learn so many new things. I also have so many options and possibilities after I get my degree so I don’t feel any limitations. I feel empowered through social work because you are giving hope to individuals and communities who may not have a lot of hope left.  

Over the summer I have relearned to love reading. I used to think I hated reading because of the books we had to read for school, but I have come to realise that I didn't like all the limitations that followed reading. I could only read a certain amount of pages, I couldn't read at my own pace, I wasn't allowed to choose what I read. This feeling of being trapped and held back by limitations translated into my love for social work because there are so many possibilities, paths, choices, and you can do so much with a social work degree. I love the idea of being able to choose something different along the way and changing it on my own terms. Currently I am reading _The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo_, and I am obsessed with it so far!

I am a military brat. My dad was in the Marine Corps, so I have lived all over the country. I’ve lived in California, Alabama, North Carolina, Louisiana, Virginia, and Texas. I have experienced so many different cultures throughout my life which influenced my desire to learn more about the different cultures and people that I will be helping throughout my career. 

Digital Humanitites is new territory for me. I have never heard of it or knew what it meant proir to this digital humanities course, so I am walking into this semester blind and I am excited to learn the world of digital humanities and the impact it has on the way that we interact with others and discover new things. While, I did sign up for this class **mostly** for the writing intensive credit, I think there is a lot to learn and plenty of opporunity to expand my writing, technological, and professional skills. 

My career goals are always changing, I currently want to work with kids whether it be in a school or hospital setting. I am currently doing an internship with [Riverside Hospice.](www.riversideonline.com/lifelong-health-and-aging/lifelong-health-and-aging/services/hospice-and-palliative-care) Through this opportunity, I have met so many amazing people who share similar passions to me. I am continuously learning what I am capable of. It continues to challenge me in ways that push me out of my comfort zone, thus teaching me new skills and experiences that I may not have gotten otherwise. I am not only growing as person but as a professional. 

Last year, I had the opportunity to visit the general assembly with my cohort. Through this amazing experience, I have become fascinated with policy, the justice system, advocacy, etc. In the future I would love to get involved in policy, whether that be creating policies or bills to help marginalized communities or supporting victims through their trials, I would love to be involved in some way.
	
While I am not studying animals anymore, I still love them, especially cats. I have 3 cats, Rudy, Luna, and Leo. They are siblings even though Luna looks nothing like her brothers.
