# Review of Monroe and Florence DH Project

## The purpose

The purpose of this project is to evaluate and update the work that Monroe and Florence did surrounding lynching. This interactive project describes who Monroe and Florence Work were. The original work of Monroe and Florence aimed to show how harmful lynching was. Lynching was used as a common form of “justice”, usually carried out by mobs of white supremacists, and now considered a terrorist tactic. The project allows me to analyze how lynchings affected my hometown or other towns. The full history of lynching was ignored by most for a hundred years. The project reintroduces the violent history that POC _(People of Color)_ have faced throughout history. It is an eye-opening and important, educational project to explore because this dark part of our history is not talked about in depth. It was a big part of our culture and history which affected a large part of the U.S population. **“Every citizen has a duty to know this story. This history belongs to everyone”**. I think this quote from the project sums up why this project was created and why it is so important.   

## A review of the technology 

There are a lot of interactive pieces within the project. One technological aspect of this project that does what older scholarship did not is language translation. The project offers the ability to switch between Spanish and English. While it does not provide more languages, it allows more accessibility than if the project was in just English. This allows a larger audience to learn more about the history of lynching. The option is provided throughout the project, so at any point, I can switch between the two. I do not know how accurate the translation is.![screen shot of a map of white supremacy's mob violence in English.

Other pieces of technology that may not have been available in previous days includes links to other resources (videos, pictures, quotes, etc.). These links are easy to navigate because they are a different color than the majority of the text. The links provide more detail or information to expand the reader’s knowledge about the project's content. The page is long and I did a lot of scrolling, but they add a button you can click when you are scrolling that takes you to the top. You can access all the tabs at any point throughout the project. This is a helpful addition because I can skip around if I want or go to a specific part of the lesson without having to go through and scroll through all parts.  

### Layout
	
The layout of the project flows well and is easy to navigate. It guides you through the “lesson” of the work that Monroe and Florence did in a way that makes sense. When you scroll to the bottom, there is a button that takes you to the next part of the lesson. This allows me to follow along with the content, which is helpful because it feels like I am following a timeline or story. However, the paragraphs feel lengthy and I find it hard to digest the information at times. 
	
There are graphs and pictures embedded throughout the project which does help keep me interested when the paragraphs get longer. The pictures are typically on the side or in the background of the text while the graphs break up some of the information. The graphs are nice to have when breaking up the text, but I found them to be a little difficult to understand.![screen shot of a graph that has different colors and different historical events and amendments](https://averylayne01.github.io/averylayne01/images/graphs.png)

### The Maps
	
The maps are an important technical part of the project. It shows just how common lynching was. It allows me to see how lynching affected a specific city or location. The map is easy to navigate for anyone who may not be familiar with the technology. Before I started to play around with the map, it showed me what different parts of the map means so that I can know how everything works before going into my exploration. You can still switch the language if desired.![screen shot of map section map features slide](https://averylayne01.github.io/averylayne01/images/MapInstructions.png)

When I first started to dive into the map’s features, instructions appeared on the screen telling me how to use the map. However, when I returned to the map these instructions did not pop up. I tried closing the site and reopening it, but the instructions were not always popping up. This could be challenging for someone who may not know how to navigate the map. 

## How accessible is this project?

There are a lot of user-friendly features to this project. There are directions that help provide guidance on how to follow the project. For someone new to technology, you will easily be able to follow along with this project. It encourages me to keep following along and not feel intimidated by complicated layouts or features. The links provide lots of beneficial information, pictures, videos, and resources that make the project more visually appealing and interesting. All of these links work and most are translated to Spanish, if you have switched the language. It also provides access to someone who may speak Spanish. This is a very important feature because someone who may not speak English or have it be their first language has the opportunity to explore this project and learn everything it has to offer. 

However, there are areas that could be improved. This project already has the ability to switch between languages, but it should offer more than just Spanish and English. I think this would broaden accessibility to those in America who speak another language and even those outside of the country would have the opportunity to explore this project. 

Another area that could be improved is text size. Throughout the lesson, the size of the text is readable. However, the text on the map is small which affects someone who may have vision impairments or a hard time reading the small text. The key is especially small. It would be beneficial if I had the option to expand the key, it would be a lot easier to read.![screenshot of a map highlighting lynchings and blue circles around small text to show that it could be larger](https://averylayne01.github.io/averylayne01/images/TextMap.jpeg)

## How it applies to Humanities

This project is focused on bringing history back and making it relevant. It discusses historical figures, events, and lynching being the main focus. It teaches the reader about past lynchings and how this form of violence came to be. It relates to the history field of the humanities because of the historical content within the project. I think the project does a good job of showing the history. The project uses not only text, but videos and other links to explain the history of Monroe and Florence Work and how they impacted what we know about lynching. 
	
A big portion of this project is the maps. There are two interactive maps. One shows white supremacy’s history of lynching and the other shows white supremacy’s mob violence. Both maps are interactive and each dot represents a documented lynching or victim of violence. With these maps, I am able to see where lynchings and other acts of violence were most prevalent. I am also able to look up specific locations which is a really neat feature. The history talked about in the project helps explain why some locations or regions had more lynchings and violent acts than others. These maps relate to the human geography field of the humanities. These maps are easy to understand. The directions do not always show up, which is something that can be improved, but they are helpful when it does.![screen shot of one of the maps with instructions listed](https://averylayne01.github.io/averylayne01/images/MapInstructions2.png)

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I think this project is very beneficial to everyone. I think it is important for everyone to learn more about the history of lynching and mob violence, as well as some of the important historical figures who played a role during this time. While this project had flaws and could use some improvements to make it more accessible, it did a great job incorporating history and human geography into an interactive learning experience for anyone who wants to learn more!
