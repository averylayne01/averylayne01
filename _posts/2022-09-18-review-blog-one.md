# Review of Monroe and Florence DH Project

## The purpose
	The purpose of this project is to evaluate and update the work that Monroe and Florence did surrounding lynching. This interactive project describes who Monroe and Florence Work were. The original work of Monroe and Florence aimed to show how harmful lynching was. Lynching was used as a common form of “justice”, usually carried out by mobs of white supremacists, now considered a terrorist tactic. The project allows me to analyze how lynching affected my hometown or other towns. The full history of lynching was ignored by most for a hundred years. The project reintroduces the violent history that POC _(People of Color)_ have faced throughout history. It is an eye opening and important, educational project to explore because this dark part of our history is not talked about in depth. It was a big part of our culture and history which affected a large part of the U.S population. **“Every citizen has a duty to know this story. This history belongs to everyone”**  

## A review of the technology 
	There is a lot of interactive pieces within the project. One technological aspect of this project that does what older scholarship did not is language translation. The project offers the ability to switch between spanish and english. While it does not provide more languages, it allows more accessibility then if the project was in just english. This allows for a larger audience
