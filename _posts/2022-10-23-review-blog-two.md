# Review of “In Pursuit of Freedom”

## A Purpose 

The purpose of “In Pursuit of Freedom” is to highlight and give credit to abolitionists and anti-slavery activists from Brooklyn, whose contributions to the city and nation were often forgotten. This project discusses the history of slavery in Brooklyn, NY, and how the individuals who fought for change impacted our society. These abolitionists (**radical activist who calls for an immediate end to slavery, and political and legal equality for African Americans, and denounces colonization schemes _[definition from the project]_**) came from all walks of life. These individuals could be man or woman, Black or White, educators, homeowners, etc. From 1783-1865, Brooklyn went from an agricultural slaveholding capital to the third-largest city fueled by the business of slavery. Because of this shift, the abolitionists and activists created networks at the local, regional, and national levels.

## The Technology

There are quite a few technical aspects to this project. While it is kept simple, these features help portray the purpose of this project.

### Visuals

One of the first things that stood out to me and I really liked about this project was the use of visuals. The visuals seem to be the main feature of the project.

The visuals consist of various forms of media ranging from photos to texts to maps. The project does a fairly good job of keeping these visuals organized by category. When you click on an image, more information regarding the specific visual pops up, giving the reader more context as to why the picture is important. It is nice that the text is not always visible so that the screen does not get too crowded. 

I also think that it is really cool that with every picture, a link to a lesson plan for a teacher is provided. I think this is a great feature that encourages teachers to educate their students about this important topic.

I think this also provides a great opportunity for students or other readers to learn more about a visual that they are interested in. All of the images and links work. If you click on an image, it will expand it, however, the text that is attached to each visual is really small and there is no option to expand this as well. 

### Layout 

The layout of the project is easy to navigate. The home page has all of the sections available so that you can easily click on what section you want to go to. It also lists the sections at the top so that you can access each section without having to go back to the home page each time. This is a really nice feature that makes navigating through the project more manageable.

However, in each section, because there are so many images the page feels a bit crowded and overwhelming at times. They categorize the images in each section which is helpful to keep it organized but it is not always clear as to what is in each category based on the way it is laid out. If you don’t hover your cursor over the category it doesn’t highlight which images go with that section. 

However, if you hover your cursor over the category, it highlights all the related visuals which helps distinguish what belongs in each category.

You can also hover your cursor over a particular visual and it will highlight the category it belongs to. I like that this project provides multiple ways to indicate what visuals are in each category because it helps me clearly distinguish what each category includes.

### Timeline 

One of the main pieces of technology used to demonstrate history is the timeline. The timeline is really simple to use, you either click on the dates or click on the pink bar to scroll through the timeline. Underneath the timeline, they separate the visuals with dates which is really useful so that the reader can know what time each visual occurred. The visuals are from the previous sections and it gives you the same information when you click on them. While the timeline appears self-explanatory to me, there is no information regarding how to use the timeline or how they choose what visuals they used. If they included a brief description of why they included a timeline and how to use it, I think that would be very beneficial.

### Other features

If you go to the resources tab at the top, it brings you to a separate page where it provides multiple other tools to improve what you learn from this project. These include games, a glossary, walking tours, other projects, and educator tools.

The glossary provides specific definitions to words that may be more important or unfamiliar to a reader which can be super helpful when really trying to understand the information. However, there may still be words that some may not know that are not in the glossary. 

The walking tour option is a great and interesting feature because allows you to get out and experience these historic locations in real time after having learned the history behind them. It is a great opportunity to be able to make the contrast between back then and now. While the idea has potential, most of the maps that are included do not work. This should be fixed so that anyone who is interested can get the information they need. Dumbo is the only location that has a working map.

I love that they have a separate tab for educators with all the lessons included. This makes it really easy for teachers to browse the content and pick what they want to use. 

The game option is a cool and unique feature I came across. It gives you a chance to reflect on what you have learned, but I did find the games a bit finicky. The drag-and-drop aspect would not always work and sometimes the icons would disappear. Overall, there is a lot of potential here and I think this option makes learning the information more exciting.

## Usability 

I have mentioned several aspects of this project that could be improved like some technical features and text size as well as things this project did well. There are other areas that I think can be improved. While the visual aspect is really nice and helpful, especially for a visual learner, the pictures sometimes felt cramped on the screen. I think that if they broke it up or spaced it out it would have made it a little less overwhelming. 
I wish that the project had the option to switch languages so that more people could enjoy the project and the content that it offers. This would have made it more accessible for other people who would like to explore the project. 

I also would have liked an option to enlarge the text and the pictures at the same time. As I mentioned, the text throughout this project is really small, making it hard to read for someone who may not be able to see very well. When you click on the pictures it expands them but covers the text. I think if there was an option to expand the picture and the text side by side, it would make the information feel more connected with what is being displayed in the visual.

If you hold your cursor over the text, a text box will sometimes pop up. It will say the same thing as the actual text and block the text. Im unsure as to why this happens. It can be distracting.

I learned a lot about the history of anti-slavery in Brooklyn while exploring this project. They had a lot of really good information and context behind each visual. However, the paragraphs felt lengthy at times, especially with the small text, I found it difficult to stay focused. Along with expanding the text size, they could also separate the paragraphs a little more. 

## How it relates to the Humanities

This project is focused on the history of what slavery looked like and the impact it had on Brooklyn society, as well as, how individuals helped change this. It explores historical events, figures, and documents that help educate the reader about the topic of the anti-slavery movement in Brooklyn. It also incorporates the use of a timeline as an interactive way to explore what happened during the alluded time period. Overall, the project does a really good job representing the history of Brooklyn’s anti-slavery movement and the history leading up to it. 

## How it relates to my grant

This project relates to my grant because it focuses a lot on different activists and their contributions to changing an unequal society. My grant is focused on highlighting historical Black social workers and showcasing their accomplishments because they are often overlooked. They had a huge impact on the civil rights movement and did a lot of advocacy for social justice which are some of social work's core values. The abolitionists were similar in a way, as they were both fighting for an equal society and largely advocated for the rights of the Black community. This project takes it back to before the civil rights movement showing that the struggle for human rights, especially for the Black community, has been a fight for longer than we may remember. I like that this project is specific to Brooklyn because we don’t always learn about how each state handled slavery and anti-slavery movements.   

## Conclusion

With a few improvements here and there, I think this project was a great way of showcasing the history that we can sometimes forget. It portrays a powerful story of the individuals who fought for social justice and change. I learned a lot of history that I was never taught in school, so I enjoyed getting to experience the history for the first time. I think exploring this project would be beneficial to everyone as it teaches history that is often overlooked.
