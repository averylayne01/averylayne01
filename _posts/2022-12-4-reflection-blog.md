# Reflection Blog 

Going into this class, I had yet to learn what the course would entail. I had never heard of digital humanities and only took the class because my advisor recommended it as an excellent class to fulfill the writing intensive requirement. While I am still figuring out what digital humanities means to me, I have come to understand that it incorporates technology as a tool to educate individuals about specific topics that fall under the humanities. 

## Twitter

One of the assignments that we had to complete this semester was Twitter posts. I did not know what to expect with this assignment; whether it would be hard or if I would struggle to find things to talk about that had not already been said. Over the course of this class, I can say this assignment had its ups and downs. On the weeks when we had no readings, I struggled to come up with something to tweet about that was not repetitive of what I had already tweeted. However, what I loved about Twitter, was being able to read what my classmates thought about different readings, peer reviews, or what they found difficult, etc. I found it comforting when I read that someone had similar difficulties or thoughts about something in the class. I also had a lot of fun creating my profile too!

## Blog posts

One of the biggest challenges for me this semester was GitHub. I was unaware that coding was involved in this course and I have never coded before. I am also not great with technology in general. GitHub gave me a run for my money and definitely tested my patience at times due to how nitpicky it is, especially when it comes to inputting images. However, getting to the finished products of the blogs was extremely satisfying and reminded me that I am capable of doing something that may not come naturally to me. This was a unique experience for me that taught me skills I hope to never forget.  

Despite the technicalities that these assignments entailed, I really enjoyed the projects overall. Looking through various projects was really interesting and taught me a lot about topics that other people are passionate about. Deep diving into the projects, and figuring out what worked and what could improve was fun, and a good segway into the grant project. We were not critiquing the content of the projects but rather their accessibility/usability and technology of them. These factors are important to think about so forcing me to be aware of the accessibility of projects was helpful and allowed me to put myself in the shoes of someone who may experience challenges when looking through projects.

## Skills for Life

This course taught me what my professional voice looked like over various forms of media which was definitely a journey. It took me a bit to find my confidence when it came to posting on twitter. Twitter was a platform I rarely frequented, so having to navigate through it as well as post something for everyone to read was daunting at times. In the beginning, I found myself second-guessing what I was posting or feeling anxious that people may disagree, but over time I got more comfortable posting and feeling confident in what I was saying. Being able to communicate appropriately, concisely, and effectively is incredibly important in todayâ€™s day and age, so the skills I learned in this course will benefit me moving forward. 

Having to navigate GitHub is also something that may benefit me in the future. While I am unsure if I will ever have to code again, if the opportunity arises I will be able to confidently say that I can handle the task. Grant writing is another skill that I could possibly utilize in the future. I now know what the process looks like and what the requirements are. Grant writing is a task I may cross paths with in my future career so it is really helpful that I have a basic understanding of the process. 

## Conclusion

Without its lack of challenges, digital humanities was an eye opening experience and a course I highly recommend. I think the content is extremely relevant and helpful for any potential career. It will teach you skills you may have never had before. It will challenge you and test your limits, but the end products are the most rewarding. I enjoyed my time in the course and I appreciate all it taught me. As I say goodbye to this class, I reflect on how much I have grown in such a short time and I look forward to what the future entails with the new skills I have acquired.
